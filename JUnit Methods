All the check methods could probably use a lot more work.  
They are basically the methods that get called when a task or user is about to be created/changed/used/etc.
Add some things to those so we can get valid checks on our stuff before implementing JUnits.

I made a list of methods that we could make JUnit tests for pretty easily (and what class they are in):

EditItemActivity:
	checkItem()
	
LoginActivity:
	checkLogin()
	
MainMapActivity:

NewItemActivity:
	checkItem()
	updateDisplay()

NewUserActivity:
	checkUser()

TODOManagerActivity:
	updateDisplay()
	onCreateOptionsMenu()
	onOptionsItemSelected()
	performFiltering()

ViewItemActivity:
